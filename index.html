<h1>Vacation Planner</h1>

<p>
The Vacation Planner is a native Android application designed to help users organize and manage travel plans in one centralized location. The app allows users to create vacations, assign accommodations and date ranges, and add excursions associated with each trip. Built-in validation ensures that excursion dates fall within the correct vacation period, and notifications help users stay on track with important travel events.
</p>

<p>
The application is developed using Java, XML, and the Android SDK in Android Studio. It follows a layered architecture with a Room (SQLite) database for local data storage, providing offline access and reliable data persistence.
