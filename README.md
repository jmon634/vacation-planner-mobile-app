Vacation Planner – Android App
Overview
Vacation Planner is an Android app to help keep travel plans organized in one place. It lets you save upcoming trips, track where you’re staying, and schedule excursions for each vacation. The app checks your dates to make sure everything makes sense, and it can also send reminders for important vacation or excursion dates.

Managing Vacations

Viewing Vacations
When the app opens, you’ll click the Start Here button and land on the Vacation List screen, which shows all vacations you’ve already saved.
Adding a Vacation
Tap the Add Vacation button to create a new trip. This opens the Vacation Details screen.
Entering Vacation Info
Here you can fill in the trip title, accommodation name, and your start and end dates. Selecting either date will open a date-picker dialog.
Saving a Vacation
Use the menu in the top-right corner and choose Save to store the vacation in the database.
Deleting a Vacation
If you need to remove a vacation, open it and select Delete from the menu. (A vacation can’t be deleted if it still has excursions linked to it.)
Generating Vacation Summary Report from Search results
Click the magnifying glass icon in the top tool bar, enter search criteria and results will automatically populate in the list. Next, click the share icon to generate a report with the vacation details.

Managing Excursions

Viewing Excursions
Tap on any vacation in the list to see its details. Any excursions connected to that vacation will appear underneath the trip info.
Adding an Excursion
Inside the Vacation Details screen, tap the Add Excursion button to add a new excursion.
Entering Excursion Details
Provide the excursion name and choose a date.
Date Validation
The app only allows excursion dates that fall within the vacation’s start and end dates. If you pick a date outside that range, you'll get an error message and won’t be able to save it.
Saving or Deleting
Use the options menu in the top-right corner to save the excursion or delete an existing one.

Setting Notifications

Vacation Planner can send push notifications so you don’t forget key dates.
Vacation Notifications
In the Vacation Details screen, open the menu and choose Remind Me When It Starts or Remind Me When It Ends. These options schedule reminders for the beginning or end of your trip.
Excursion Notifications
While editing an excursion, open the menu and select Remind Me. This sets a reminder for the excursion’s date, using the date currently shown in the field.

Navigation

Use the top toolbar’s Back Arrow or your device’s back button to move between screens (e.g., from Excursion Details → Vacation Details → Vacation List).
Any changes you make will appear immediately once you return to the appropriate screen.
